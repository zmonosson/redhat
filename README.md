# Date Picker Prototype

This prototype was used to test an eternicode date picker created by Andrew Rowls in order to determine what default behaviors and features should be supported by https://www.patternfly.org/.

The specific behaviors/features tested were:

- Autoclose
- Today button
- The icon associated with the component
- Text input

Note: after pulling this repo, the Font Awesome icons may not appear. If this is the case: run index.html by using gulp. See instructions here and note that the gulpfile.js has been created already:
